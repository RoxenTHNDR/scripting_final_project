# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

During our first week in class we mainly learned about Git and Github. After talking with a friend who works in the coding field about github I found out that it, or a renamed version of it, is a fairly common thing in the work place. Our main focus was on memorizing the commands for git to put our repsitory onto Github. Such as adding commiting and pushing. 

One of the things that I also found really interesting was how easy it made sharing code. Instead of ziping the file or copy and pasting a whole block of code, I could simply copy and paste a link to my repository. 

## Chapter 1

Our main focus this week was to learn to add Javascript to HTML. This was a challenge for me as the assignment was a refresher course for me on HTML. To insert javascript into a HTML document you need the `<script>` tags. The assignment was to build a NFT card in HTML. The most difficult part about this assignment was the hover for the main image and getting the eye centered. It has been about a year since I had taken HTML, and the limited experience Iâ€™ve had in other cases have used a visual editor, so I really needed this crash course.

## Chapter 2

The main focus of this week was on Array's and objects. I find these very interesting because they are extremely similar to Python. However when I first went through arrays in Python it went over my head. However now, I don't know if its because I have had more classes and understanding programing more but it just clicked. The assignment, found in the folder "Chapter2", was what I think really helped it cement how similar it is to python in just building the array's with a few differences.
