# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

During our first week in class we mainly learned about Git and Github. After talking with a friend who works in the coding field about github I found out that it, or a renamed version of it, is a fairly common thing in the work place. Our main focus was on memorizing the commands for git to put our repsitory onto Github. Such as adding commiting and pushing. 

One of the things that I also found really interesting was how easy it made sharing code. Instead of ziping the file or copy and pasting a whole block of code, I could simply copy and paste a link to my repository. 

## Chapter 1

Our main focus this week was to learn to add Javascript to HTML. This was a challenge for me as the assignment was a refresher course for me on HTML. To insert javascript into a HTML document you need the `<script>` tags. The assignment was to build a NFT card in HTML. The most difficult part about this assignment was the hover for the main image and getting the eye centered. It has been about a year since I had taken HTML, and the limited experience Iâ€™ve had in other cases have used a visual editor, so I really needed this crash course.

## Chapter 2

The main focus of this week was on Array's and objects. I find these very interesting because they are extremely similar to Python. However when I first went through arrays in Python it went over my head. However now, I don't know if its because I have had more classes and understanding programing more but it just clicked. The assignment, found in the folder "Chapter2", was what I think really helped it cement how similar it is to python in just building the array's with a few differences.

## Chapter 3

The focus of our time in chapter 3 was both completing and getting us ready to build base programs on our own, such as this [hangman game](https://roxenthndr.github.io/scripting_final_project/Hangman/). I really enjoyed this chapter as it gave me a sense of accomplishment upon completing a few programs completely on my own, such as the Chapter3 folder within this repository. It may just be a basic find the average of the numbers imputed by the user, however it was creating the handling so that there were no errors that piqued my interest. At the point of writing this I have yet to completely start on the game that is assigned next week, however I am looking forward to completing that as well, I'm thinking of doing a cup and ball guessing game.

## Chapter 4

In chapter 4 we mainly talked about forms and how to build them. On top of different ways to get user input. I feel like this is probably one of the most important chapters thus fair, due to the fact practically any website now is going to have some sort of form, whether that be shopping or simply creating an account for their website. For the assignment the thing I am most proud of was creating classes based off of user inputs so that it would make it easier to filter through a table. 

## Final Project

My final project was loosly based off a childhood favorite game, called Card-jitsu. This game was a more complicated version of rock paper scissors. While playing this you would earn expierience towards your black belt. To progess further than that you had to challenge sensei and win. However, if you had tried to challenge sensei before you reached black belt it would be impossible to beat hom. So keeping the same vien I made it to where its impossible to win the challenge until you have at least 10 wins in practice.
